# This repo

I'm keen to do some hacking with the [RFS major incidents data](http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/feeds/majorIncidents.xml) at Railscamp later this week. This repo is geared to help me do that, as I'll need to start collecting data early on (no internet!).

## What's going on here

1. Download the GeoRSS feed from the RFS and store the headers as well.
2. Convert the GeoRSS to GeoJSON using [Ogre's API](http://ogre.adc4gis.com/) and store it.
3. Commit these files to the git repo and push up to Github.

I'll put this on a box somewhere and get it to run hourly. I must remember to git pull before I head to Railscamp.
